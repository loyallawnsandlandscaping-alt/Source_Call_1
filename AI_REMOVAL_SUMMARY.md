# AI Functionality Removal Summary

## Overview
All AI-related functionality has been completely removed from the React Native + Expo messaging and video calling app to improve performance, reduce bundle size, and enhance user privacy. This is now a pure instant video chat and messaging app with no AI components.

## Completely Disabled AI Files
- `app/(tabs)/ai.tsx` - AI tab screen (redirects to main screen)
- `hooks/useAI.ts` - AI processing hooks (throws errors if accessed)
- `hooks/useAIOrchestration.ts` - AI model orchestration (throws errors if accessed)
- `components/AIInsightsCard.tsx` - AI insights display component (throws errors if accessed)
- `components/AIModelCard.tsx` - AI model management component (throws errors if accessed)
- `utils/aiModelRegistry.ts` - AI model registry and configuration (throws errors if accessed)

## Modified Files
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Completely removed AI tab from navigation
- All AI files now throw errors if any code tries to import or use them

## Status: AI COMPLETELY REMOVED ✅
- No AI functionality exists in the application
- All AI imports will cause errors
- AI tab removed from navigation
- Focus is now 100% on instant messaging, video calling, camera, and drum kit features

## Remaining Core Features
✅ **Messaging System**
- One-on-one and group chat
- Real-time messaging with Supabase
- Media sharing (images, videos, audio, files)
- Message reactions and replies
- Typing indicators

✅ **Video/Audio Calling**

## Benefits of AI Removal
- **Improved Performance**: Significantly reduced app bundle size and memory usage
- **Enhanced Privacy**: No AI data collection or processing
- **Better Battery Life**: Removed computationally intensive AI operations
- **Faster Load Times**: Eliminated heavy AI model loading
- **Simplified Codebase**: Cleaner, more maintainable code structure

## Alternative Approaches
Instead of AI features, the app now focuses on:
- Manual user interactions and preferences
- Standard camera and media functionality
- Real-time communication without AI enhancement
- User-controlled settings and customization

The app maintains all core messaging and calling functionality while providing a cleaner, more focused user experience.
