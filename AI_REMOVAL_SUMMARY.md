# AI Functionality Removal Summary

## Overview
All AI-related functionality has been completely removed from the React Native + Expo messaging and video calling app to improve performance, reduce bundle size, and enhance user privacy.

## Removed Files
- `app/(tabs)/ai.tsx` - AI tab screen
- `hooks/useAI.ts` - AI processing hooks
- `hooks/useAIOrchestration.ts` - AI model orchestration
- `components/AIInsightsCard.tsx` - AI insights display component
- `components/AIModelCard.tsx` - AI model management component
- `utils/aiModelRegistry.ts` - AI model registry and configuration

## Modified Files
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Removed AI tab from navigation
- `types/index.ts` - Removed all AI-related type definitions

## Remaining Core Features
✅ **Messaging System**
- One-on-one and group chat
- Real-time messaging with Supabase
- Media sharing (images, videos, audio, files)
- Message reactions and replies
- Typing indicators

✅ **Video/Audio Calling**
- Individual and group calls
- Call history and management
- Audio/video controls (mute, speaker, video toggle)
- Call status tracking (incoming, outgoing, active, ended, missed)

✅ **Camera Functionality**
- Photo and video capture
- Standard camera controls
- Media gallery integration

✅ **Drum Kit Feature**

- Privacy settings

✅ **Settings & Preferences**
- Theme customization (light/dark/auto)
- Notification preferences

- Accessibility settings

## Benefits of AI Removal
- **Improved Performance**: Significantly reduced app bundle size and memory usage
- **Enhanced Privacy**: No AI data collection or processing
- **Better Battery Life**: Removed computationally intensive AI operations
- **Faster Load Times**: Eliminated heavy AI model loading
- **Simplified Codebase**: Cleaner, more maintainable code structure

## Alternative Approaches
Instead of AI features, the app now focuses on:
- Manual user interactions and preferences
- Standard camera and media functionality
- Real-time communication without AI enhancement
- User-controlled settings and customization

The app maintains all core messaging and calling functionality while providing a cleaner, more focused user experience.
