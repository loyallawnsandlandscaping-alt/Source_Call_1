# Source Call - Setup Instructions

## Current Status

The app is now working properly! The issues that were preventing the login screen from showing have been resolved:

### Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ **Missing expo-camera dependency** - Added the missing `expo-camera` package
2. ✅ **Font loading error** - Removed the problematic font loading that was causing bundling failures
3. ✅ **Authentication flow** - Enhanced the authentication flow with better debugging and error handling

## How to Test the App

### 1. Demo Login (Local Mode)
Since Supabase is not configured, the app runs in local demo mode:

- **Email:** `demo@sourcecall.com`
- **Password:** `demo123`

### 2. Features Available
- ✅ **Authentication** - Sign in/out with demo credentials
- ✅ **Messaging** - View mock chat conversations
- ✅ **Camera** - Take photos and videos (AI features disabled for performance)
- ✅ **Drum Kit** - Interactive drum kit with 35+ sounds
- ✅ **Settings** - User preferences and account management

### 3. Network Connectivity
The original error you saw (`ERR_NGROK_3200`) was caused by:
- Missing `expo-camera` dependency preventing the development server from starting
- Font loading issues causing bundling failures

These have been resolved and the app should now load properly.

## Optional: Supabase Setup

To enable full backend features:

1. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
2. Add your Supabase project URL and anon key
3. The app will automatically detect and use Supabase when configured

## Development

The app is now ready for development and testing. All core features work in demo mode, and you can add your own Supabase configuration when ready for production features.
